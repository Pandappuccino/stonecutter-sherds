# Stonecutter Sherds
My first attempt at a (simple) datapack for Minecraft Java Edition!

This pack adds all 23 pottery sherd patterns to the Stonecutter, which can be cut from a brick. The purpose of this pack is to minimize the need for players to have to hunt down decorated pots just to get the sherds they want.

Tested in the latest version as of posting (version 1.21.11), should work on all 1.21.x releases.
